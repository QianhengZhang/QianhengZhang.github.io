This talk presents a scalable approach for predicting inter-county food flows using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We discuss model architecture, data integration strategies, and the implications for food supply chain optimization at regional and national scales.

Presented at ACM 2025 SigSpatial, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States (11/2025).
