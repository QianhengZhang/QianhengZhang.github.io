Welcome! I am a Ph.D. student in Cartography and Geographic Information Science at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, advised by Prof. Song Gao in the [Geospatial Data Science Lab](https://geods.geography.wisc.edu/).

My research focuses on the intersection of **artificial intelligence and geospatial analysis**, with an emphasis on **large language models (LLMs), graph neural networks (GNNs), and scalable machine learning pipelines**. I am particularly interested in how people interact with data—not just applying or visualizing it, but designing **human-centered AI systems** that support reasoning, interpretation, and decision-making.

I have applied these methods to diverse domains, including **food system resilience**, **urban human–wildlife interactions**, and **benchmarking LLMs for spatial reasoning**. My broader goal is to develop interpretable, ethical, and scalable geospatial AI systems that contribute to sustainability, infrastructure resilience, and human well-being.

Here you can find information about my [publications](/publications/), [talks](/talks/), [portforlio](/_portfolio/), and [CV](/cv/).
