Research Experiences —————————————————————
Lead Developer | OSU ICICLE Program - GNN Food Flow                          January 2025 – Present
Built scalable data and training pipelines for GNN-based prediction of 10M+ food flows, leveraging distributed computing on HPC clusters. Prototyped models with PyTorch and optimized performance metrics (AUC 0.82, R² 0.36).
Using inference results in flow volume regression across food categories, with developing open-source outputs for national-scale infrastructure resilience studies.
Lead Researcher | GeoAnalystBench Project                                                   October 2024 – Present
Developed and deployed a benchmark of 50+ tasks to evaluate LLMs (Transformer-based architectures) on reasoning and code generation; designed data pipeline and evaluation framework (CodeBLEU, workflow metrics). Showed how LLMs can be rapidly prototyped and tested for domain-specific intelligence.
Designed the evaluation framework using metrics like CodeBLEU and workflow difference to measure alignment between LLM and human reasoning; results showed proprietary LLMs outperformed open-source models on task structure and semantic flow.
Categorized tasks into applied spatial analysis types (e.g., "Determining Relationships", "Predictive Modeling"), revealing that LLM performance varies significantly across GIS domains.
Researcher | Urban Wildlife & Human Mobility                                        September 2024 – Present
Led a study analyzing over 5,000 coyote sightings with multi-scale human mobility data (SafeGraph) in Los Angeles County during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
Framed an ambiguous ecological question (coyote-human interactions post-Covid) into ML tasks; applied SEM and GWR for spatiotemporal modeling, integrating human mobility data.
Discovered significant inflow/outflow effects on urban coyote presence, demonstrating behavioral plasticity to human movement.
Research Assistant | OSU ICICLE Program - ScienceAgentBench       April 2024 - October 2024
Designed and annotated 25+ complex GIS and spatial reasoning tasks to benchmark large language models on geospatial intelligence.
Contributed to a 15% improvement in GIS-specific LLM task accuracy through the design of reproducible workflows and evaluation scripts.
Developed a taxonomy of spatial agent task types to improve the scientific rigor of GIS AI benchmarks.
