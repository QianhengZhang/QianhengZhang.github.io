This dynamic map visualizes the data from Damron's Men's Travel Guide throughout 2000, 2005, 2014/2015, to 2019 editions. The Damron's guide is considered as a second-to-none collection of gay-friendly venues in the United States. In the guide, each venue is categorized by its location. We enumerated the number of venues of each locality, and then resample the data with unique-size hexagons in a 125km radius. As shown by this web map, the number of venues increases to the peak at 2010, and then sharply shrunk in 2014/15 and in 2019. It is worth noting that, the men guide mainly focuses on the Gay community and thus the venues on lesbian and other queer groups are not represented. So, with the current web map as a test bed, we plan to collect a more inclusive data set in the near future. Explore it in [Shifting Queer Space in the United States](https://hgis.uw.edu/shiftingqueerspace/).
